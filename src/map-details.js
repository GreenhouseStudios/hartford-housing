      "Hartford’s present extent of 18 square miles is an artifact of town and city amalgamation between 1784 and 1896. The census conducted a few years after incorporation estimated the city’s population to be 2683. Each charter revision redefined the city in relation to its commercial business district as well as the future suburbs of East Hartford, Manchester, and West Hartford. By 1881, the town and city had coterminous boundaries and consolidated government followed in April 1896. Native American, European, and African communities shaped the early histories of mobility, displacement, dispossession, and settlement in Hartford. The three Great Migrations of African Americans, West Indians, and Puerto Ricans would shape the twentieth-century trajectory of the city as earlier generations of European migrants had done before them.",
